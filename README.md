# Matrix Factorizations:

This repository contains the various matrix factorization methods that I'm in the process of trying out. It additionally also contains some linear algebra tools and utilities.

The files of this repository are contained in:
* `header`: Here the factorization methods / utilities are declared.
* `test`: In this folder, the implementation of the various methods declared in `header` are checked. It also contains the timing runs for some standard functions like matvec, LU, QR, etc.
