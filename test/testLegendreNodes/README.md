# Comparison of Analytic and Numerical Legendre Nodes:

This folder contains the analytic nodes(taken from [here](https://github.com/sivaramambikasaran/Quadrature/tree/master/Gauss_Legendre/nodes)) and numerical nodes computed using the companion matrix as returned by the library. We plot the error as a function of resolution and find that error stays < 1e-14 till N = 128.
